# Programming Kata: Conway's game of life

Collection of Conway's game of life implementations in languages I know

## Requirements

1. For given array of boolean(or bit), returns next array (ref: [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))
2. Draw the visualized result onto Web using Canvas and WebGL(2d)
3. At least 60 animation frames per sec
4. Small and clean code as possible

## Language rules

1. If a result is JavaScript, it should be loadable (bundled by Webpack as needed)
2. If a language is interoperable to JavaScript, it should follow rule#1
3. If it's native language, it should be compiled to WebAssembly then follows rule#1
4. if it doesn't support JavaScript or WebAssembly, any reason to use? :smirk:
